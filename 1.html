  target="_blank" title="Holybible site">Not to us, O LORD,</a> not to us but to your name be the glory, because of <strong>your <u>love</u> and faithfulness.</strong> Why do the nations say, "Where is their God?" Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him. But their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.

Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them. O house of Israel, trust in the LORD--he is their help and shield. O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD--he is their help and shield.</p>
